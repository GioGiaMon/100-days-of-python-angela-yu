## Hangman Game (Day 7 – Stage 5)

This is my implementation of the classic Hangman game, built as part of Angela Yu’s Python Bootcamp.

The game includes:

- ✅ Modular structure: `hangman_words.py` (word list), `hangman_art.py` (logo & stages), and `main.py`
- ✅ Player has **6 lives** to guess the word
- ✅ ASCII art updates after each guess
- ✅ Warning if a letter was already guessed — and no life is lost
- ✅ Message when user wins or loses, with the correct word displayed



### 🕹️ How to play

```bash
python main.py


A word is chosen randomly.

You guess letters one at a time.

You have 6 lives—ASCII art shows your hangman status.

Guess all letters before running out of lives to win!
